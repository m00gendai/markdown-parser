Custom markdown to HTML5 parser.

Vercel blog templates with markdown files for nextjs blogs do not suffice, as I require to insert HTML and React Components into the blog posts.
.mdx files are a pain to get working.

So I created my own parser to transform my custom markdown to valid HTML5.
Its use case specific so use at your own risk. Will be enhanced on an as-needed basis.
